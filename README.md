# frd-go

A client for SSE (server-sent events) events sent by Flashbots Relayers which follows the 
[Flashbots Relay API specification](https://flashbots.notion.site/Relay-API-Spec-5fb0819366954962bc02e81cb33840f5#286c858c4ba24e58ada6348d8d4b71ec).

## How does it work ?

Using the [sse package](https://github.com/r3labs/sse) made by r3labs, it connects to the 
provided relayer and subscribe to incoming events.

These events are forwarded in a channel you can use in your own application.
